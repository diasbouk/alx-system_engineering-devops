# LTS

    What does LTS mean?

Copyright - Plagiarism

    You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
    You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
    You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
    Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

# Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
    All your files should end with a new line (why?)
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
    A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
    You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;
    All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the chmod command: chmod u+x file. Later, we’ll learn more about how to utilize this command.

# More Info

    Example of line count and first line

    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ wc -l 12-file_type 
    2 12-file_type
    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ head -n 1 12-file_type 
    #!/bin/bash
    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ 

    In order to test your scripts, you will need to use this command: chmod u+x file. We will see later what does chmod mean and do, but you can have a look at man chmod if you are curious.

# Example

    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls
    12-file_type
    lll
    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -la lll
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ cat lll
    #!/bin/bash
    ls
    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -l lll
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ chmod u+x lll # you do not have to understand this yet
    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -l lll
    -rwxrw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ./lll
    12-file_type
    lll
    julien@ubuntu:/tmp$
